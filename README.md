#Automated Web Vulnerability Scanner (AWVS)
#Overview
AWVS is a Python-Flask tool for deep, authenticated vulnerability scanning of modern web applications. It automates the discovery of flaws like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, and Broken Access Control (IDOR) in both public and authenticated areas, generating both PDF and JSON reports for stakeholders and developers.

Features
Authenticated scanning (handles login, CSRF tokens)

Tests for SQLi, XSS, IDOR, and missing headers

SPA-aware crawler for modern apps

Reports in PDF (for management) and JSON (for devs)

Secure output (AES-256, auto-deletion, access control)

User warnings & ethical compliance built-in

#Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/awvs.git
cd awvs
pip install -r requirements.txt
Quick Start
bash
python webapp.py
Open your browser and navigate to the local provided address. Enter your scan target credentials, launch, and download your scan results.

#Usage Example
Insert your web targets one by one, or paste a JSON array for batch scans:

json
[
  {
    "baseurl": "https://example.com",
    "loginurl": "https://example.com/login",
    "username": "user1",
    "password": "securepassword"
  }
]
#Technical Details
Backend: Python 3.x, Flask, requests, BeautifulSoup

Reporting: reportlab (PDF), JSON output

Security: Encrypted outputs, controlled retention, user authentication

Main file: webapp.py

Core class: WebsiteScanner — manages stateful, session-based scan logic

#Evaluation
Reduced scan time from 48h (manual) to under 5min

High detection rate for tested vulnerabilities (Reflected XSS, Error-based SQLi, IDOR)

Tested in live and intentionally vulnerable environments

#Limitations
Does not support advanced login flows (CAPTCHA/MFA)

Focuses on URL-parameter flaws (not full business logic analysis)

No headless browser automation (pure HTTP/HTML/SPA logic)

#Ethics
Authorized Testing Only: Use with owner’s written permission

User Authentication & Data Security: All findings are encrypted and deleted after 7 days

Code of Conduct: Explicit warnings and compliance statements protect responsible use
